# BME60B_Sandbox
sandbox for group 12

hello we made minesweeper on MATLAB

you can download all the code in a zip file by clicking the green button saying "<> code" and choosing the "Download as ZIP" option or whatever it says

you can run the game by opening the folder in MATLAB (or copying all the files into your working MATLAB folder) and running Group12.m
(as long as you have the files Group12.m and mineEngine.m in the folder you have open in MATLAB, then running Group12.m should work)

ya if anyone actually cares to see this hope u enjoy the game
